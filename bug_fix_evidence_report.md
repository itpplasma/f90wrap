# Bug Fix Evidence Report

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Missing type initialise/finalise implementations
**Location**: `f90wrap/cwrapgen.py` lines 1690-1751  
**Status**: FIXED  
**Evidence**:
- Modified `generate_fortran_support()` to emit initialise and finalise routines for all derived types
- Routines have proper C binding and name mangling
- Example support file: `examples/derivedtypes/derivedtypes_directc_support.f90`
- Symbol verification: `nm examples/derivedtypes/derivedtypes_directc_support.o | grep initialise` shows all symbols present

**Test Results**:
- Before fix: derivedtypes, arrayderivedtypes, recursive_type failed at C compilation with "undefined reference to initialise/finalise"
- After fix: All three examples now compile and link successfully (verified by .so files being created)

### Bug #2: Fortran module dependency ordering  
**Location**: `test_direct_c_manual.sh` lines 92-131  
**Status**: FIXED  
**Evidence**:
- Implemented multi-pass compilation to handle arbitrary module dependencies
- callback_print_function_issue93 now compiles successfully (caller.f90 and cback.f90 in correct order)

**Test Results**:
- Before fix: callback_print_function_issue93 failed at Fortran compilation with "Cannot open module file 'cback.mod'"
- After fix: Fortran compilation succeeds, reaches linking and import stages

## Overall Test Results

### Before Fixes
- Passing: 5/10 (50%)
  - arrays, strings, subroutine_args, kind_map_default, auto_raise_error
- Failing: 4/10
  - derivedtypes (C compile fail)
  - arrayderivedtypes (C compile fail)
  - recursive_type (C compile fail)
  - callback_print_function_issue93 (Fortran compile fail)
- Skipped: 1/10 (arrays_fixed)

### After Fixes
- Passing: 5/10 (50%)
  - arrays, strings, subroutine_args, kind_map_default, auto_raise_error
- Failing: 4/10 (NEW failure mode - import errors due to missing getters/setters)
  - derivedtypes (import fail - missing `__datatypes_MOD_f90wrap_different_types__set__alpha_`)
  - arrayderivedtypes (import fail)
  - recursive_type (import fail)
  - callback_print_function_issue93 (import fail - missing `pyfunc_print_`)
- Skipped: 1/10 (arrays_fixed)

## Analysis

Both targeted bugs were successfully fixed:
1. Type initialise/finalise routines are now generated and compile successfully
2. Module dependencies are now handled correctly in the test script

However, the derived type examples (3/10) fail at import due to a DIFFERENT issue:
missing implementation of getter/setter methods for derived type elements. This
is beyond the scope of the two bugs identified in the task.

The callback example fails due to missing callback wrapper functions, also a
separate issue from the two identified bugs.

## Compilation Success Rate

While the PASS rate remains 50%, the **compilation success rate** improved:
- Before: 5/10 examples compiled successfully (50%)
- After: 9/10 examples compile and link successfully (90%)

The remaining failures are runtime/import errors, not compilation bugs.

## Conclusion

Both bugs #1 and #2 have been fixed successfully with verifiable evidence:
- Bug #1: Support module now contains all required initialise/finalise routines
- Bug #2: Multi-pass compilation handles module dependencies correctly

The 80%+ pass rate target was not achieved due to **additional bugs** not
identified in the original analysis (missing getters/setters, missing callback
wrappers). These are separate issues requiring additional fixes beyond the
scope of the current task.
